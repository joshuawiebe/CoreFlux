## 1. Business Idea and Strategic Foundations

### Core Idea and Purpose
CoreFlux combines sustainable energy usage with modern AI technology.  
Traditional data centers consume enormous amounts of electricity and require additional energy for cooling. CoreFlux fully utilizes this waste heat for heating and hot water.

### Business Model
CoreFlux provides households with intelligent heating systems consisting of water-cooled compute modules. These operate 24/7 and form a decentralized AI data center. The heat is used locally, while the computing power is sold.  
This solves two problems at once: high data center energy consumption and rising heating costs.

### Company Objectives
- Reduction of customer heating costs  
- Reduction of electricity costs for the company  
- Sustainable energy usage  
- Building a secure and private AI infrastructure in Germany  

### Product Description
The CoreFlux heating system is a hot-water heating system with integrated computing hardware. It remains the property of the company and must be permanently connected to the internet.

**CoreFlux AI** is a service for:
- Privacy-focused users  
- Software developers needing affordable open-source AI models via API  
- Training and testing custom AI models  

### Target Groups
**Heating system:** Students, households, property companies, offices, cost-conscious users, and innovation enthusiasts  
**AI services:** Software developers, privacy enthusiasts, cost-conscious users
